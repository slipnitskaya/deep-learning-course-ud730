# Deep learning with TensorFlow Course


### Project goal
This repository contains materials for the Udacity's Deep Learning [course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) written using the TensorFlow framework.
The following notebook collection demonstrates basics of deep learning applied to the classification task on the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset.

### Structure

1. Exploring notMNIST using Machine learning ([notebook](https://github.com/slipnitskaya/deep-learning-tensorflow-ud730/blob/main/1_notmnist.ipynb)).
2. Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks ([notebook](https://github.com/slipnitskaya/deep-learning-tensorflow-ud730/blob/main/2_fullyconnected.ipynb)).
2. Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning ([notebook](https://github.com/slipnitskaya/deep-learning-tensorflow-ud730/blob/main/3_regularization.ipynb)).
4. Convolutional Neural Networks ([notebook](https://github.com/slipnitskaya/deep-learning-tensorflow-ud730/blob/main/4_convolutions.ipynb)).

###Libraries
Packages needed to be installed in order to reproduce the code are `six`, `numpy`, `ipython`, `imageio`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
